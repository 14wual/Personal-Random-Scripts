<h2>Book recommendation algorithm</h2>
<b>How does it work?</b> <br>
This "Book recommendation algorithm" features <b>mysql.connector</b>, <b>mysql.connector</b>, <b>random</b> and <b>time</b>. <br>
<b>What's this?</b> - 
This is a book recommendation algorithm, where the algorithm recommends titles based on your votes.<br>

<h2>Progressive Bar Timer</h2>
<b>How does it work?</b> <br>
This "Timer with Progressive Bar" has <b>tqdm</b> y <b>time</b>. <br>
<b>What's this?</b> - 
In this program we introduce a time and the program will create a progressive bar with a countdown <br>

<h2>Password Generator</h2>
<b>How does it work?</b> <br>
This "Password Generator" features <b>random</b>. <br>
<b>What's this?</b> -
We start with 4 strings that contain the following characters <i>(lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and special characters)</i>
The user, <i>enters the length and difficulty</i> of the password where the program, according to its response, joins the different strings and with that base
a <i>for</i> is responsible for randomly choosing the characters according to the previously configured difficulty and length to create a secure password.<br>

<h2>Password Validator</h2>
<b>How does it work?</b> <br>
This "Password Validator" can work with <b>random</b>. <br>
<b>What's this?</b> - 
We start from an input where you write your passwords, the code makes use of the <i> methods islower(), isupper() and isdigit()</i>. When going through the algorithm
This checks the types of characters that your passwords have and if they do not meet the requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters) a new one
is generated. <br>

More exercises will be added soon

<h2>Code Examples</h2>

```
if vote == "-":
    for y in myresult:
        if author in myresult[1]:
            myresult.remove(y)
elif vote == "+":
    upvote += 1
        if upvote == 3:
            print("Congratulations!\nYou have found your gender: %s" % gender)
            exit()
```
```
for s in range(longitud):
    a = random.choice(str(lista))
    contraseÃ±a += a
```
```
print("Timer will start on:")
    temp = 3
    for i in range(temp):
        temp -=1
        print(temp,end='\r')
        sleep(1)
```
